This project was a school project that i had to do. Overall it was just a bad made game.
The point of it was thet you would run around in different stages and shoot ever enemy you see and nothing more.
But you can only run around and shoot right now. There is on enemys there are only walls.

If you are wondering why i'm uploading a unfinished project to github
It's because that was a part of the assignment we had.



The program i used was unity. It's a really good tool if you know what you are doing.
